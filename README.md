# MCTBNCs

## Supported datasets
Datasets can be stored and presented in different formats. Currently, this software supports the following:
* Unique CSV file (TO DO)
* Sequences stored in individual CSV files (see, for example, the post-stroke rehabilitation dataset [REFERENCE])

## Learning MCTBNCs
This software provides the following algorithms for the learning of a MCTBNC.
### Parameter learning algorithms
* Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

### Structure learning algorithms
#### Optimization algorithms
* Greedy hill climbing 

#### Score functions
* Log-likelihood score
  * BIC penalization
